zero to hero coursework
## Projects so far
*tic tac toe that I did independently
*tic tac toe that I did after watching a little more of the lectures, 
not sure what they did to verify input cause I didnt finish the lectures 
and instead used error handling to ensure integers where I cast user input to int
*war card game, I watched my way through the class setup, then figured out gameplay on my own
