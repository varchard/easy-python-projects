zero to hero coursework
## Projects so far
*tic tac toe that I did independently based on the suggestion to make it  
*tic tac toe that I did after watching a little more of the lectures outlining the project,  
not sure what they did to verify input cause I didnt finish the lectures.  
instead I used error handling to ensure integers where I cast user input to int  
*war card game, I watched my way through the class setup, then figured out gameplay on my own
*Quotes_scraper scrapes HTML for element tags using requests and beautiful soup for a variety of
of elements, on watching the video I see that the instructor handled the loop slightly differently
but I like my solution of breaking the loop when a bad response is returned from the URL
*chapter_puzzle overlays a mask on a list of words to reveal a message, the images used are at Pierian
Data Complete Python Bootcamp's GitHub. I figured out how to specifically turn the white pixels transparent
which I found to be a much more satisfying solution than just turning the whole mask layer slightly transparent
